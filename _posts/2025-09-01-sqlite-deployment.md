# Planning SQLite Deployment to Production

SQLite is often overlooked for production deployments, but it can be an excellent choice for small to medium applications. Here's how to plan your SQLite deployment strategy.

# Timeline
Day 0 - when you deploy your application for the first time
DAy 1 - the first day when your applicaiotn is "open for business"

# Code organization
Below is the complete set of files and scripts you'll need:
```
.gitignore
scripts/
  install-upgrade-sqlite.sh
  copy-db-prod-to-dev.sh
  db-maintenance.sh
database/
  db/
    development/
      my-app-dev.sqlite
    production/
      my-app-prod-2025-09-01.sqlite
    test/
      my-app-test.sqlite
  sql/
    00-schema-init.sql
    00-data-init.sql
    01-schema-add-column-abc.sql
    02-data-add-historical.sql
    05-schema-add-table5.sql
```

Here is the purpose of each directory/file:
| Path                                 | Description                                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| .gitignore                           | Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git, including the production database. |
| scripts/                             | Contains utility scripts for database management and deployment. |
| scripts/copy-db-prod-to-dev.sh       | Script to copy the production database to the development environment for testing or debugging. |
| database/                            | Root directory for all database-related files.    |
| database/db/                         | Contains environment-specific SQLite database files. |
| database/db/development/             | Stores the developer-specific SQLite database files. Should never be checked into version control. |
| database/db/production/              | Stores the temporary copy of production SQLite database file. Should never be checked into version control. |
| database/db/production/my-app-prod-2025-09-01.sqlite | A temporary copy of the prod db file. Always suffixed with the date (and time) of copy. |
| database/db/test/                    | Test data for the project's unit tests. Should be checked into version control. |
| database/sql/                        | Contains SQL scripts for schema and data management. |
| database/sql/00-data-init.sql        | SQL script to seed the production database with initial data. For one-time execution only.|


## .gitignore
```
database/db/development/*
database/db/production/*
```


## Data Seeding Strategy

**Development Environment:**
- Use sample data that mimics production structure
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Keep datasets small but representative

**Staging Environment:**
- Use anonymized production data when possible
- Ensure data volume matches production expectations
- Test with realistic user scenarios

## Testing Data Management

**Test Data Isolation:**
- Use separate SQLite files for each test suite
- Implement database factories for consistent test data
- Clean up test data after each test run

**Data Validation:**
- Test with various data types and sizes
- Verify constraints and triggers work correctly
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid data

## Production Data Considerations

**Backup Strategy:**
- Implement automated daily backups
- Use WAL mode for better concurrency
- Consider point-in-time recovery options

**Performance Optimization:**
- Create appropriate indexes for query patterns
- Use prepared statements to avoid recompilation
- Monitor query performance in production

**Data Migration:**
- Plan schema changes carefully
- Test migrations on staging first
- Have rollback procedures ready

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Database file permissions set correctly
- [ ] Backup scripts configured and tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting in place
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

SQLite can handle production workloads effectively when properly planned and maintained. The key is understanding your data patterns and implementing the right operational procedures.
