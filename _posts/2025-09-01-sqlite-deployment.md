SQLite is a simple database, but even then, its production deployment can be complex and tricky.
Here's how to plan your SQLite deployment strategy, including testing, development and maintenance.

Assumptions:
1. This guide assumes your project uses a single SQLite database. If your application requires multiple SQLite databases, you will need to adjust the architecture and deployment procedures accordingly.

# Timeline
- `Day 0` - when you deploy your application to production for the first time
- `Day 1` - the first day when your applicaiotn is "open for business"
- `Day B` - day on which a backup is done

# Code & Data organization
Below is a comprehensive list of the database files, Bash scripts, and Python scripts you will need, along with a suggested directory structure:
```tree
.gitignore
database/
  db/
    development/
      my-app-dev.sqlite
    production/
      my-app-prod-2025-09-01.sqlite
    test/
      my-app-test.sqlite
  scripts/
    install-upgrade-sqlite.sh
    copy-db-prod-to-dev.sh
    db-constants.sh
    db-maintenance.sh
    day-0.sh
  sql/
    00-schema-init.sql
    01-data-init.sql
    02-schema-add-column-abc.sql
    03-data-add-historical.sql
    04-schema-add-table5.sql
  data/
    01-reference-data.csv
    03-historical.csv
  logs/
    sql-commands.log
    database-operations.log
```

Here is the purpose of each directory/file:

| Path                                                      | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.gitignore`                                              | Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git, including the production database.       |

| `database/`                                               | Root directory for all database-related files: actual db files, utility scripts, and data files.        |
| `database/db/`                                            | Contains environment-specific SQLite database files.                                           |
| `database/db/development/`                                | If required, stores the developer-specific SQLite database files. These files should *never* be checked into version control. |
| `database/db/production/`                                 | If required, stores any temporary copy of production SQLite database file. These files should *never* be checked into version control. |
| `database/db/production/my-app-prod-2025-09-01.sqlite`    | A temporary copy of the prod db file. Always suffixed with the date (and time) of copy.        |
| `database/db/test/`                                       | Stores test data for the project's unit tests. Should be checked into version control.                |
| `database/db/test/my-app-test.sqlite`                     | Test data for the project's unit tests. Should be checked into version control.                |
| `database/scripts/`                                       | Contains utility scripts for database management and deployment.                               |
| `database/scripts/copy-db-prod-to-dev.sh`                 | Script to copy the production database to the development environment, for testing or debugging.|
| `database/scripts/db-constants.sh`                        | Script containing common constants related to our db. To be used by all other scripts.|
| `database/sql/`                                           | Contains SQL scripts for schema and data management. Monotonically increasing numbered prefix for all files. Treat files in this folder as **immutable** once they have been executed in production.|
| `database/sql/00-schema-init.sql`                         | SQL script to create an empty db with all the schemas. For one-time execution (Day 0) only.            |
| `database/sql/01-data-init.sql`                           | SQL script to seed the production database with initial data. For one-time execution (Day 0) only.     |
| `database/data/`                                          | Place to store any (small) data files. E.g. test data, or reference data files for Day-0, etc. |
| `database/logs/`                                          | Directory for SQL command logs and database operation logs. Files in this folder should *never* be checked into version control. |

# Day 0 - Production Deployment
Script used: `day-0.sh`

1. Create db - Before you open for business, you'll of course want to create an empty db file with schema.
2. Data Seeding - We often have data which we want to be present in our db even before we are "open for business".
For example, reference data tables, historical data, etc.

**Development Environment:**
- Use sample data that mimics production structure
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Keep datasets small but representative

**Staging Environment:**
- Use anonymized production data when possible
- Ensure data volume matches production expectations

# Testing Data Management

**Test Data Isolation:**
- Use separate SQLite files for each test suite
- Implement database factories for consistent test data

**Data Validation:**
- Test with various data types and sizes
- Verify constraints and triggers work correctly
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid data

# Production Data Considerations

**Backup Strategy:**
- Implement automated daily backups
- Use WAL mode for better concurrency
- Consider point-in-time recovery options

**Performance Optimization:**
- Create appropriate indexes for query patterns
- Use prepared statements to avoid recompilation
- Monitor query performance in production

**Data Migration:**
- Plan schema changes carefully
- Test migrations on staging first
- Have rollback procedures ready

# Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Database file permissions set correctly
- [ ] Backup scripts configured and tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting in place
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

SQLite can handle production workloads effectively when properly planned and maintained. The key is understanding your data patterns and implementing the right operational procedures.
